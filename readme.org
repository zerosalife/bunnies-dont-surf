* Bunnies Don't Surf
You are an unfortunate rabbit whose warren is being flooded by a
passing thunderstorm.  You have to navigate the tunnels of the warren,
propelled by the wave of water flooding your home.  There's only one
problem: *Bunnies Don't Surf*.  So you're stuck hopping up and down in
a futile attempt to survive.

*Bunnies Don't Surf* requires [[http://www.python.org/][Python]] and [[http://pygame.org/news.html][pygame]] ([[http://pygame.org/download.shtml][version 1.9.1]]) to
play.  Start it with =python run.py= from the command line.

This is a WIP prototype.

Tap =SPACE= to hop. That's all there is to say about the controls.
